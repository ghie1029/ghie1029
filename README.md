With over a decade in data science, analytics, and product development, I recently served as an Engineering Manager at relayr, a top industrial IoT company specializing in digital transformation solutions.

I led cross-functional teams handling the core functions and user interface of our analytics product, which uses machine learning to deliver insights and recommendations for industrial clients. I empowered my teams to work autonomously while aligning with the product vision and business goals. I do high collaboration with product managers, fellow engineering managers, executives, and stakeholders.

I have a passion for inspiring teams to deliver to business solutions. I've applied my skills across banking, telecom, retail, and software engineering, leading projects that delivered significant business value and customer satisfaction.

Eager to learn new technologies and work with diverse teams, I aim to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems and improve lives.
